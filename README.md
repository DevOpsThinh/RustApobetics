## Motivation/ Opportunity

After more than 4 years as a mobile application software developer (middle-level), I have the desire to contribute more value to the community, not only at the level of being a member creating mobile applications for smartphone users. Along with that, I always research and update trends in all aspects of software technology in particular and computer science in general.

From trending keywords such as "Green Software", "Durable Software", "Chronicle of Coders", "Sustainability Leaders", "Digital Carbon Footprint", .... And from there, I have had answers to naive concerns such as: Can AI completely replace technicians like us? How to go on the right path of "software development", how to achieve the "right outcome", ...
From those premises, I began to search for solutions to shape my own future in the era of booming digital technology, but along with that, wars and political conflicts are happening in many places around the world, and climate change has affected the lives of millions, even billions of people in this world. From there, problems arise that need to be solved such as:

- Food security;
- Environmental pollution (e-waste, microplastic waste);
- Industrialization, urbanization;
- Digital data era.

Therefore, as a programmer, I personally need to act immediately to contribute to protecting myself and the community, whether in the local area where I live or elsewhere in the world. But after I think back on what I learned as a student, it is almost very difficult to meet. Whether it's low-level, intermediate-level programming languages ​​like C/C++ or high-level programming languages ​​like C#, Python, ... they still have complexities and cause big trade-offs in use for the entire ecosystem that I intend to develop and which language is energy-efficient programming languages ?.

Finally, I decided to use Rust (a new programming language for me but easy to approach because I have a foundation in other C-family languages ​​like C++, Java, JavaScript, C#, Kotlin). And that was a step for me to start developing this project. And this is a project that will last, maybe 1-3 years, but during that time, I will force myself to have a useful product to release for testing in a real environment. Therefore, the short introductions here are just the beginning of the story, of the journey. So there will be updates in the future. Please join me on this journey!

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.91.1+

- RustRover 2025 or other IDEs with a plugin (Rust Analyzer) for Rust, or

- [Compiler Explorer & Rust](https://godbolt.org/) (Only some parts of our code);

- [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2024).

## Installation

## Parts

### I. Rust Fundamental

- [Rust Standard Library (Types, Data Structures, ...)](https://github.com/DevOpsThinh/RustApobetics/tree/master/language_foundation/src)

### II. Program Algorithms with Rust

- [Algorithms (Cryptography, ...)](https://github.com/DevOpsThinh/RustApobetics/tree/master/algorithms_foundation/src)

### III. Mini Projects

- [A highly addictive game called Bevy Volleyball](https://github.com/DevOpsThinh/RustApobetics/tree/master/mini_projects/bevy_volleyball)

I'm not only a mobile application developer for Android, but I also work on Apple platforms, especially iOS. This includes developing gaming applications using frameworks like SpriteKit, GameplayKit, and GameKit. This mini-project is my way of showcasing a style of developing gaming applications using a framework (a data-driven game engine built in Rust), namely [Bevy](https://bevy.org/).<br>

**What are we building?**<br>

Inspired by a small project in the book by two authors (Shing Lyu and Andrew Rzeznik), titled: 
[Practical Rust Projects: Build Serverless, AI, Machine Learning, Embedded, Game, and Web Applications, 2e](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-9331-7)


The video game can be downloaded at: [bevy_volleyball.mp4](https://github.com/DevOpsThinh/RustApobetics/tree/master/videos/bevy_volleyball.mp4)<br>

Using the Bevy **ECS pattern** and a **data-driven game engine**, we have:

  - Working with the application’s OS window

  - Create Scenes with Sprites

  - Execute queries to access components, global resources, and local resources

  - Manipulate both single texture images and sprite sheets

  - Create modular plugins

  - Use Iterative Design to Adjust the character's movement

  - Working with Physics and Collision Detection

  - Build more robust sound systems

  - Juicing the game with sound and effects<br>

=> **Next** (these are exercises for both you and me):

  - Create an Endless Scrolling Background

  - Enhancement Player's Experience with Particles Effect

  - Add more scenes and saving the game, and more...

<hr>

- [Elektor Store](https://github.com/DevOpsThinh/RustApobetics/tree/master/mini_projects/elektor_store)

In this project, we've explored several key areas in software engineering with Rust:

- Data modeling with structs and enums;
- An approach to Generic Programming (Rust's Const generic parameter syntax);
- A like object-oriented programming model based on Composition over Inheritance;
- Handling user input safely, avoiding errors, and ensuring a good user experience;
- Ownership and Borrowing techniques (in action) in Rust;
- Using Sub-modules to split large Rust files into manageable components.
